# Calculator - Android Native

This is a practice application to learn basic Android development in Kotlin.
This application makes use of LiveData to update input and output in realtime.

Some little things that I learned while making this app
- 0dp width or height to occupy available space
- use of regular expressions to validate strings
- MVVM architecture
